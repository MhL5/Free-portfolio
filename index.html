          My name is Mohammad Hosein Lashani.
          <br />
          I have always been passionate about technology and design, and I
          decided to pursue my interests by studying computer science and web
          development. <br />
          As a junior developer, I am eager to learn and improve my skills, and
          I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and
          solve problems. In my spare time, I like to experiment with new
          programming languages, explore the latest trends in web design, and
          play video games. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead
          and look forward to making a positive impact in the web industry.
